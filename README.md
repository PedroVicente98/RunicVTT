# Runic VTT

**Runic VTT** is a peer-to-peer **Virtual Tabletop (VTT)** for tabletop RPGs, built in C++ with [libdatachannel](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel).  
It enables direct peer-to-peer sessions without the need for centralized servers.

---

## Features
- Peer-to-peer networking with WebRTC (`libdatachannel`)
- Entity-Component System (ECS) with `flecs`
- Modern UI built on `ImGui`
- OpenGL-based rendering with `GLEW`, `GLFW`, and `GLM`
- Cross-platform architecture (primary target: Windows)
